let c;
let a = 34;
let b = 21;

console.log(a+b) //first expression
// Prediction: It will output 55 because 34 and 21 are numbers 34+21=55
// Actual: 55

a = 2;

console.log(a+b) //second expression
// Prediction: it will output to 23 because 34 has been replaced by 2 which means now it is 2+21=23
// Actual: 23

console.log (c)
// Prediction: as nothing has been stored in c it should be null
// Actual: undefined


console.log(3 + 4 + '5');
// Prediction: since 3 and 4 are figures then 3+4=7 then adding string '5' give 75
// Actual: 75
