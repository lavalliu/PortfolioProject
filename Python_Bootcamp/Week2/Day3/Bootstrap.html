        One advantage of using the Bootstrap 5 CDN:
        Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 5 from jsDelivr when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.
        
        JavaScript?
        Bootstrap 5 uses JavaScript for different components (like modals, tooltips, popovers etc). However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need them.
