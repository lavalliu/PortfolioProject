// Exercise 4 : Employees #2
// Instructions
// Using this object:

const students = [{name: "Ray", course: "Computer Science", isPassed: true}, 
               {name: "Liam", course: "Computer Science", isPassed: false}, 
               {name: "Jenner", course: "Information Technology", isPassed: true}, 
               {name: "Marco", course: "Robotics", isPassed: true}, 
               {name: "Kimberly", course: "Artificial Intelligence", isPassed: false}, 
               {name: "Jamie", course: "Big Data", isPassed: false}];

// Using the filter() method, create a new array, containing the students that passed the course.
// Bonus : Chain the filter method with a forEach method, to congratulate the students with their name and course name 
// (ie. “Good job Jenner, you passed the course in Information Technology”, “Good Job Marco you passed the course in Robotics” ect…)

let result = students.filter(user => user.isPassed == true);
console.log(result);

result.forEach((student, i) => {
    console.log(`Good job ${student.name}, you passed the course in Information technology`)
});
